            <br>
            <p>My knowledge of HTML began in the early 2000s, making simple calendars for work events and my own personal projects. In 2022 I came to Ozark Technical Community College and expanded that knowledge, while adding CSS and Javascript in to add style and funtionality. I've created several websites as class projects, and have taken on several family member's businesses to test my hand at real world situations. HTML gives a solid basis on which to build upon when it comes to compute languages, so I will be taking on the advanced class in Spring of 2023. I believe it will even further prepare me for more applicable projects within a work environment.</p>
